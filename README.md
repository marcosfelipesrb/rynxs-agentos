> **Production-ready Kubernetes platform for running governed "AI computers"** — agents with real capabilities (workspace, shell, browser) but with auditability, safety, and operational control.

Rynxs combines **event-sourced state management**, **leader election**, **S3-backed durable logs**, and **production-grade observability** to deliver a platform you can actually run in production.

This isn't "magic guarantees" — it's **mitigated, observable, and forensically analyzable** reliability aligned with distributed systems reality.

---

## Getting Started: Choose Your Path

Rynxs offers two deployment paths depending on your goal:

### 🚀 Production Deployment (Helm) — **RECOMMENDED**

**Use this if:** You're deploying to production or need HA, durability, and operational safety.

![Helm Install Demo](assets/demo-helm-install.svg)

```bash
# Production deployment with HA (3 replicas, S3 event log, leader election)
helm install rynxs ./helm/rynxs -n rynxs --create-namespace -f helm/rynxs/values-production.yaml

# Verify installation
kubectl get pods -n rynxs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=rynxs
```

**⚠️ Multi-zone requirement:** Production values use `whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule` for zone spread (hard constraint). If your cluster has fewer than 2 zones, pods will remain Pending. For single-zone clusters, override with `ScheduleAnyway` in custom values or use default values (no zone constraint).

**Next step:** [`docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md) — 10-step validation + 2-minute smoke test

---

### 🔬 Development/Proof (Kustomize) — Quick Demo

**Use this if:** You want to explore Rynxs quickly or understand the operator without production complexity.

```bash
# Install CRDs + operator (single replica, local PVC)
kubectl apply -f crds/
kubectl apply -k deploy/kustomize/base

# Create test agent
kubectl apply -f docs/examples/agent.yaml

# Watch operator logs
kubectl logs -f -l app=rynxs-operator
```

**Note:** This mode uses local PVC storage and is **not suitable for HA or production**.

**Upgrade path:** For production, migrate to Helm deployment (see migration guide in [`helm/rynxs/README.md`](helm/rynxs/README.md))

---

## What is Rynxs?

**The problem:**
AI agents need "computer capabilities" (shell, file system, browser, tools) to be useful. But giving unrestricted access is dangerous:
- Agents can corrupt data, leak secrets, consume unlimited resources
- Multiple agents can conflict with each other
- Debugging agent behavior is nearly impossible without audit trails

**Rynxs solves this:**
A Kubernetes-native platform that gives agents **governed computer capabilities**:
- ✅ Agents get workspaces, tools, and sandboxed execution environments
- ✅ Every action is recorded in an **immutable, hash-chained audit log**
- ✅ Policies enforce isolation, resource limits, and network access controls
- ✅ Operations teams can observe, debug, and control the system with **metrics, alerts, and runbooks**

**In one sentence:**
Rynxs = "AI computers" with governance, auditability, and operational safety.

---

## Key Capabilities

### Production-Ready Infrastructure
- **One-command deployment** — Helm chart with production defaults, least-privilege RBAC, documented lifecycle
- **High availability** — Multi-replica operator with Kubernetes Lease leader election and tested failover
- **Durable event log** — S3/MinIO append-only storage with hash-chain integrity and tamper detection
- **Production observability** — Prometheus metrics, critical alerts with runbooks, structured JSON logs

### Security & Governance
- **Policy-enforced execution** — Default-deny networking, sandboxed jobs (gVisor/Kata support)
- **Immutable audit trail** — Dual-layer: workspace-level traces + S3-backed event log (hash-chained)
- **Forensic traceability** — Fencing tokens, split-brain detection, post-mortem analysis tools
- **Compliance baseline** — Non-root containers, read-only root FS, Pod Security Admission

### Operational Safety
- **Controlled risk posture** — No "magic guarantees"; split-brain is **mitigated** and **forensically analyzable**
- **Go-live checklist** — 10-step validation + 2-minute smoke test
- **Alerts + runbooks** — RynxsNoLeader, RynxsLeaderFlap, RynxsEventStoreErrorsHigh, and more
- **S3 enforcement** — Bucket policy with conditional writes (If-None-Match) prevents log corruption

---

## Threat Model & Operational Assumptions

Rynxs is designed with **honest security assumptions** — understanding what the platform guarantees and where operational discipline is required.

### What Rynxs Provides

✅ **Event sourcing + hash-chain integrity** — Tamper-evident audit log (detect corruption, not prevent)
✅ **Leader election** — Best-effort single-writer via Kubernetes Lease (split-brain is **mitigated**, not eliminated)
✅ **S3 conditional writes** — Infrastructure-level CAS (If-None-Match) prevents duplicate sequence writes
✅ **Observability** — Metrics, alerts, runbooks for incident detection and response
✅ **Forensic traceability** — Fencing tokens + event metadata enable post-mortem analysis

### What Rynxs Requires (Operational Responsibilities)

⚠️ **CNI with NetworkPolicy enforcement** — Default-deny networking depends on CNI (Calico, Cilium, Weave)
⚠️ **S3 bucket policy enforcement** — AWS S3 supports If-None-Match (MinIO policy enforcement not guaranteed)
⚠️ **Multi-zone cluster topology** — Zone spread constraints require `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` node labels
⚠️ **Namespace labeling standards** — Metrics NetworkPolicy relies on standard labels (e.g., `name=prometheus`)
⚠️ **Cluster RBAC scope** — Operator requires cluster-level permissions (namespace-scoped mode: roadmap)

### Controlled Risks (Not Eliminated, But Observable)

🔍 **Split-brain** — Network partitions can separate leader from API server (mitigated via cooldown + CAS + forensics)
🔍 **Clock skew** — Lease expiration edge cases exist (Kubernetes API timestamps used, not local clocks)
🔍 **S3 lifecycle** — Unbounded event log growth requires retention policy (operational concern, not automated)

**Documentation:**
- S3 bucket policy setup: [`docs/S3_BUCKET_POLICY.md`](docs/S3_BUCKET_POLICY.md)
- RBAC permissions rationale: [`docs/RBAC.md`](docs/RBAC.md)
- Split-brain runbooks: [`docs/PROMETHEUS_ALERTS.md`](docs/PROMETHEUS_ALERTS.md)

## Architecture Overview

Rynxs uses a **Kubernetes operator pattern** with **event-sourced state management**:

### Control Plane
- **Operator** watches `Agent` and `Universe` CRDs
- **Event-sourced reconciliation** with append-only log (every state change is an event)
- **Leader election** for HA (Kubernetes Lease API)
- **S3/MinIO durable storage** with hash-chain integrity

### Execution Plane
- **Agent runtime** with workspace + dual audit trail:
  - Workspace-level traces (`/workspace/audit.jsonl`)
  - S3-backed event log (hash-chained, for HA and forensic integrity)
- **Sandboxed jobs** for shell/browser execution (Kubernetes Jobs with TTL cleanup)
- **Default-deny networking** (NetworkPolicy)
- **Optional gVisor/Kata** runtime isolation

### Security Defaults
- Non-root containers (`runAsNonRoot: true`)
- Read-only root filesystem
- No privilege escalation (`allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`)
- Minimal capabilities (`drop: ["ALL"]`)
- Pod Security Admission (baseline/restricted profiles)

**Learn more:** [`docs/PRIMER.md`](docs/PRIMER.md) explains the system from first principles.

## Quick Start

### Agent Execution Demo

![Agent Execution Demo](assets/demo-agent-execution.svg)

### Step 1: Install Rynxs

**Production (Helm - recommended):**
```bash
helm install rynxs ./helm/rynxs -n rynxs --create-namespace -f helm/rynxs/values-production.yaml
```

**Development (Kustomize):**
```bash
kubectl apply -f crds/
kubectl apply -k deploy/kustomize/base
```

### Step 2: Create an Agent

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: universe.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: my-agent
  namespace: rynxs
spec:
  role: sandbox
  image: python:3.11-slim
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "256Mi"
      cpu: "100m"
EOF
```

### Step 3: Verify Agent is Running

```bash
kubectl get pods -n rynxs -l app=universe-agent
# NAME            READY   STATUS    AGE
# my-agent-0      1/1     Running   10s
```

### Step 4: Send a Task

```bash
POD=$(kubectl get pods -n rynxs -l app=universe-agent -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

kubectl exec -n rynxs $POD -- sh -c 'echo "{\"text\":\"run uname -a in sandbox\"}" >> /workspace/inbox.jsonl'
```

### Step 5: Verify Sandbox Job + Audit Trail

```bash
# Check sandbox job was created
kubectl get jobs -n rynxs | grep sandbox-shell

# Verify audit trail (hash-chained)
kubectl exec -n rynxs $POD -- tail -3 /workspace/audit.jsonl

# Check output
kubectl exec -n rynxs $POD -- tail -1 /workspace/outbox.jsonl
```

**Expected:** Sandbox job completes, audit trail contains hash-chained event, output appears in outbox.
